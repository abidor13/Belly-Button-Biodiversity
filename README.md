# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Project Overview:

### This project collected a demographic information of bacteria data from volunteers' belly buttons.
### Utilizing the data given in the samples.json file, we created an interactive dashboard to visualize each volunteer's belly button biodiversity.

## Project Results:

### The Horizontal Bar Chart displays each subject's top ten bacterial species in their navels.
